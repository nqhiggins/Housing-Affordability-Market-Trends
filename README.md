## Description

This project analyzed housing affordability across 99 Iowa counties using income, rent, and home value data from 2019 to 2022. The goal is to understand how income relates to housing affordability, which counties have seen the biggest cost increases, and whether housing prices and rents are rising faster than incomes in certain areas.

## How to Run Program

Download the following csv files: "Iowa_Counties_FIPS.csv" & "Iowa_Median_Household_Income_in_the_Past_12_Months_(ACS_5-Year_Estimates)_20251113.csv". Then open the Juypter Notebook file and hit run.

## Files Used

This project primarily uses data from the Iowa Data Portal  and additional data pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau’s API. We also created a separate CSV file listing all Iowa counties and their FIPS codes, sourced from the National Weather Service. This allowed us to use the FIPS codes when calling the Census API and then match the results back to the correct county names in my dataset.

## Additional Documentation

**There is not any additional documentation at this time.**

## Versioning
This group project had two people making regular updates often.
